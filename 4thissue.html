            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Our goal is to create the best possible coding school at the lowest possible cost for students. If we succeed with this, it’ll give anyone who wants to become a software developer a realistic shot at succeeding. Regardless of where they live and the size of their wallets.

                “To achieve this, we’ve created a new video format for code screencasts. We call it “scrims”.
                This format is the backbone of our school. Not only because it results in a superior learning experience. But also because it enables us to iterate more quickly, to attract better teachers, to facilitate better peer-learning, to keep server costs low, and much more.</p>
